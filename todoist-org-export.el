;;; Commentary:

;; This library implements a function to export tasks of org-agenda as
;; tasks of todoist.
;;
;; This file is based on ox-icalendar.el (bundled with org).
;; Most of the functions in this file depend on todoist.el
;; <https://github.com/abrochard/emacs-todoist>.

;;; Setup:

;; You need to set up todoist.el

;;; Usage:

;; 1. =M-x org-agenda= to open a list of agenda
;; 2. =M-x org-current-agenda-export-todoist= to export the current tasks.

;;; Code:

(require 'ox-icalendar)
(require 'todoist)
